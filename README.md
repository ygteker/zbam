## Overview

Zbam is an intuitive iOS flashcard application that transforms learning into an engaging experience. Using familiar swipe gestures, users can interact with flashcards in a fun, Tinder-like interface while tracking their progress through beautiful visualizations.

Whether you're learning a new language, studying for exams, or memorizing anything else — Zbam makes the process smooth and enjoyable.

## Features

### Swipe to Learn
Interact with flashcards using intuitive swipe gestures. Swipe right when you know it, left when you don't. Tap to flip and reveal the answer.

### Smart Progress Tracking
Every swipe is recorded. Zbam maintains a history of your responses for each card, helping you identify which cards need more practice.

### Visual Statistics
Beautiful pie charts and detailed breakdowns show your learning progress at a glance. See which cards you've mastered and which need attention.

### Card Management
Create, edit, and organize your flashcards with ease. View swipe history for individual cards and track your improvement over time.

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ygteker/Zbam.git
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   cd Zbam
   open Zbam.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and run**

   Select your target device or simulator and press `Cmd + R`

## Usage

### Creating Cards
Tap the `+` button in the Cards tab to create a new flashcard. Enter the front (question) and back (answer) content.

### Studying
Navigate to the Swipe tab and start learning:
- **Tap** a card to flip it
- **Swipe right** if you knew the answer
- **Swipe left** if you didn't
- Review your progress in the Stats tab

### Tracking Progress
Each card maintains a history of your last 10 swipes, visualized as a colored bar in the Cards list. Green indicates correct responses, red indicates incorrect ones.

## Architecture

Zbam follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models** — Data structures with SwiftData persistence
- **Views** — SwiftUI components with declarative UI
- **Stores** — Data access and business logic layer

The app leverages SwiftData's `@Model` macro for automatic persistence and SwiftUI's `@Query` for reactive data binding.
